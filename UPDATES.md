 ### UPDATES.md 

# this doc keeps record of all Library Updates/addition to the project

# endeavour is to ensure the project is 100% Kotlin & Compose project
# endeavour is to ensure library stack is KMP compatible
# endeavour is to ensure all libraries are updated to latest releases within 3 months 
# keep library nomenclature simple, crisp & well documented

# Suggestions:

- Koin be used as dependency injection instead of Dagger Hilt as it is 100% KMP compatible & simple to implement 
- Material3 be replaced by Material2 ; project should be material 3 only
- Warning *: longish AI responses are being stored in room db; fine for now, but need a workaround
- 

# Additions & Updates:

- 19/05/2024:  
    - Kotlin & KSP updated to 2.1.21-2.0.1 ; Kotlin updates also warrants a KSP update
    - simplified ksp nomenclature in all modules
