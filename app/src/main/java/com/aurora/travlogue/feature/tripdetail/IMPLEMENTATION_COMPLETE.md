## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing Needed
- [ ] Navigate from Home to Trip Detail
- [ ] Test with fixed date trips
- [ ] Test with flexible date trips
- [ ] Test empty states (no locations/activities)
- [ ] Test day expansion/collapse
- [ ] Test tab switching
- [ ] Test with long trip names
- [ ] Test with many days (20+)
- [ ] Test error states
- [ ] Test loading states

### Test Scenarios
1. **Empty Trip**: Trip with no locations/activities/bookings
2. **Minimal Trip**: Trip with 1 location, 1 activity
3. **Full Trip**: Trip with multiple locations, activities per day, bookings
4. **Long Trip**: 30+ day trip to test performance
5. **Flexible Trip**: Trip without fixed dates

## 💡 Key Decisions Made

### Design Decisions
1. **Tab-Based Navigation**: Chose tabs over vertical scroll for better organization
2. **Expandable Cards**: Day cards expand to show details, keeping overview clean
3. **Time Slot Grouping**: Activities organized by Morning/Afternoon/Evening for clarity
4. **Empty States**: Helpful messages guide users to add content
5. **Statistics Chips**: Visual chips in header for quick metrics

### Technical Decisions
1. **Flow-Based Loading**: Reactive data loading with automatic updates
2. **Computed Properties**: Statistics calculated from data, not stored
3. **Set-Based Expansion**: Efficient tracking of expanded days
4. **Domain Models**: Separate DaySchedule model for business logic
5. **JOIN Queries**: Efficient data loading with database JOINs

## Quick Start Guide

### To Use This Feature:
1. Update `HomeScreen.kt` to navigate on trip card click:
   ```kotlin
   onTripClick = { tripId ->
       navController.navigate(TripDetail(tripId = tripId))
   }
   ```

2. Run the app and tap any trip card

3. Explore the four tabs:
   - **Timeline**: Day-by-day view
   - **Locations**: Destination list
   - **Bookings**: Reservation list
   - **Overview**: Statistics & notes

### To Add Test Data:
Use Room Inspector or add via repository:
```kotlin
// Add location
repository.insertLocation(Location(
    tripId = "trip-id",
    name = "Barcelona",
    country = "Spain",
    date = "2025-11-15",
    order = 1
))

// Add activity
repository.insertActivity(Activity(
    locationId = "location-id",
    title = "Visit Sagrada Familia",
    timeSlot = TimeSlot.MORNING,
    type = ActivityType.ATTRACTION,
    date = "2025-11-15"
))
```
