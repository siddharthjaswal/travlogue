## Key Features Implemented

### ViewModel Logic
✅ **Day Schedule Generation**:
- Automatically generates day-by-day schedule for fixed date trips
- Handles flexible date trips with location-based organization
- Groups activities by time slot (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Full Day)
- Calculates day numbers and associations with locations

✅ **Data Loading**:
- Reactive data loading with Flow
- Loads trip, locations, activities, and bookings
- Handles loading states and errors
- Retry functionality for failed loads

✅ **State Management**:
- Tab selection state
- Expandable day cards with Set-based tracking
- Computed properties for counts and validations
- One-time UI events for navigation

### Repository Enhancements
✅ **Comprehensive Queries**:
- Get all locations for a trip
- Get all activities for a trip (with JOIN)
- Get all bookings for a trip
- Get activities for specific location

✅ **CRUD Operations**:
- Full CRUD for locations
- Full CRUD for activities
- Full CRUD for bookings

## Architecture Decisions

### State Management
- **Single source of truth**: ViewModel holds all UI state
- **Reactive updates**: Flow-based data loading
- **Immutable state**: Copy-based updates with `.update {}`
- **Event handling**: SharedFlow for one-time events

### Data Flow
```
TripRepository → ViewModel → UiState → Composables
     ↓               ↓          ↓
   DAOs         Transform   Render UI
     ↓           to Domain
 Room DB         Models
```

### Component Organization
- **Presentation**: Screen-level composables and ViewModel
- **Components**: Reusable UI components organized by feature
- **Domain**: Business logic and data models
- **Data**: Repository and DAOs (in core module)

## Next Session Plan

5. Build and test navigation flow

### Following Tasks (1-2 hours)
1. Implement `DayCard.kt` with expand/collapse
2. Implement `ActivityItem.kt` to display activities
3. Implement `LocationsTab.kt` with location list

5. Add empty states for all tabs

### Polish & Testing (30 min)
1. Add loading states
2. Add error states
3. Test with mock data
4. Refine UI/UX based on testing

## Notes & Considerations

### Performance
- Lazy loading of activities when day cards are expanded
- Consider pagination for trips with 20+ days
- Cache day schedules to avoid regeneration

### Accessibility
- Ensure proper semantic labels for screen readers
- High contrast support for dates and times
- Keyboard navigation for day expansion
- Minimum 48dp touch targets

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for ViewModel day schedule generation
- Integration tests for repository data aggregation
- UI tests for tab navigation and expansion
- Screenshot tests for different states

### Future Enhancements Priority
1. Add/Edit functionality (Phase 2)
2. Rich notes and attachments (Phase 2)
3. Smart suggestions (Phase 3)
4. Collaboration features (Phase 3)
5. Offline support (Phase 3)
