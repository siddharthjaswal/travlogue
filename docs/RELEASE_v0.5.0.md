## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### ViewModel Enhancements

Added 6 new methods for edit dialog management:

**Edit Dialog Show/Hide:**
- `showEditActivityDialog(Activity)` - Opens edit dialog with activity data
- `hideEditActivityDialog()` - Closes edit dialog and clears state
- `showEditLocationDialog(Location)` - Opens edit dialog with location data
- `hideEditLocationDialog()` - Closes edit dialog and clears state
- `showEditBookingDialog(Booking)` - Opens edit dialog with booking data
- `hideEditBookingDialog()` - Closes edit dialog and clears state

**State Management:**
- Stores editing entity in UiState (`editingActivity`, `editingLocation`, `editingBooking`)
- Dialog visibility flags (`showEditActivityDialog`, etc.)
- Smart cast fix using Kotlin's `let` scope function
- Null-safe handling throughout

### UI Component Updates

**Made Components Clickable:**
- `DayCard.kt` - Activity items now clickable with tap feedback
- `LocationsTab.kt` - Location cards now clickable (Card onClick)
- `BookingsTab.kt` - Booking cards now clickable (Card onClick)
- `TimelineTab.kt` - Passes activity click handler through layers

**Click Handler Flow:**
1. User taps item → 2. Component calls onClick → 3. ViewModel shows dialog → 4. Dialog opens with pre-filled data

### State Management Pattern

```kotlin
// In TripDetailScreen.kt
uiState.editingActivity?.let { activity ->
    if (uiState.showEditActivityDialog) {
        EditActivityDialog(
            activity = activity,
            onDismiss = viewModel::hideEditActivityDialog,
            onSave = { updatedActivity ->
                viewModel.updateActivity(updatedActivity)
                viewModel.hideEditActivityDialog()
            },
            onDelete = {
                viewModel.deleteActivity(activity.id)
                viewModel.hideEditActivityDialog()
            },
            locations = uiState.locations
        )
    }
}
```

This pattern:
- Uses `let` to safely unwrap nullable entity
- Avoids Kotlin smart cast issues
- Maintains type safety
- Ensures data consistency

## 📊 User Experience Flow

### Editing Flow

1. **User taps** an activity, location, or booking
2. **Edit dialog opens** with all fields pre-filled
3. **User modifies** data with real-time validation
4. **User taps Save Changes**:
   - Validation runs
   - Data updates in database
   - Dialog closes automatically
   - Success snackbar appears: "Activity updated successfully"
   - UI refreshes immediately via Flow

### Deleting Flow

1. **User opens** edit dialog for an item
2. **User taps Delete** button (red outlined button at bottom)
3. **Confirmation dialog appears** with warning:
   - Activities: "Are you sure you want to delete [name]?"
   - Locations: "⚠️ This will also delete all activities associated with this location."
   - Bookings: "Are you sure you want to delete this booking from [provider]?"
4. **User confirms or cancels**
5. **If confirmed**:
   - Entity deleted from database (cascade delete for locations)
   - Both dialogs close
   - Success snackbar: "Location deleted successfully"
   - UI updates immediately

## 💡 Developer Notes

### Technical Highlights

1. **Smart Cast Fix**
   - Used Kotlin's `let` scope function to avoid smart cast issues
   - Pattern: `uiState.editingActivity?.let { activity -> ... }`
   - Ensures type safety and null safety

2. **Bottom Action Bar Pattern**
   - Reusable pattern across all edit dialogs
   - Three buttons: Cancel (outlined), Save (filled), Delete (outlined red)
   - Consistent spacing and system insets handling

3. **Delete Confirmations**
   - AlertDialog with clear warning messages
   - Entity-specific warnings (cascade delete for locations)
   - Error color for destructive actions
   - Cancel and Delete buttons

4. **Pre-population Strategy**
   - `remember { mutableStateOf(entity.field) }` for each field
   - Initializes state from existing entity data
   - Allows editing while maintaining reactive state

5. **Clickable Items**
   - Activities: Added `.clickable { }` modifier to Row
   - Locations: Used Card's built-in `onClick` parameter
   - Bookings: Used Card's built-in `onClick` parameter
   - Consistent tap feedback across all items

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Went Well

1. **Consistent Patterns** - Bottom action bar and delete confirmations followed same pattern across all dialogs
2. **Smart Cast Fix** - Using `let` scope function elegantly solved the smart cast issue
3. **Incremental Development** - Building on v0.4.0's foundation made this release smooth
4. **Type Safety** - Kotlin's type system caught many potential bugs at compile time
5. **Reactive Architecture** - Flow-based updates made UI sync trivial

### Challenges Overcome

1. **Smart Cast Issues** - Kotlin couldn't smart cast `uiState.editingActivity` because it's a delegated property
   - **Solution:** Used `let` scope function to safely unwrap nullable entity
2. **Cascade Delete UX** - Needed to warn users that deleting a location deletes activities
   - **Solution:** Added specific warning in delete confirmation dialog
3. **Pre-population** - Needed to initialize all form fields from existing data
   - **Solution:** Used `remember { mutableStateOf(entity.field) }` pattern
