## [Unreleased]

### Added - Timeline Enhancements (v0.9.0) ‚úÖ **Timeline Intelligence**

**Complete Journey Visualization & Activity Validation**

- **Origin Departure Cards** - Departure from non-Location cities
  - Shows departure from origin city (e.g., home city not in trip locations)
  - Displays departure time, provider, and destination
  - Extracted city name from booking's fromLocation field
  - Component: `OriginDepartureCard` in `CityTransitionCard.kt`

- **Transit Cards with Timezone Transitions** - In-transit status display ‚≠ê **Key Feature**
  - Shows "IN TRANSIT" status between departure and arrival
  - Transit duration calculation (hours and minutes)
  - Provider and booking information
  - **Timezone Transition Box** (when crossing timezones):
    - Source timezone abbreviation and UTC offset
    - Destination timezone abbreviation and UTC offset
    - Calculated hour shift (e.g., "+16 hours timezone shift")
    - Visual arrow indicator showing transition direction
    - Only appears when timezones differ between departure and arrival
  - Component: `TransitCard` in `TransitCard.kt`

- **Complete Journey Flow** - Departure ‚Üí In Transit ‚Üí Arrival sequence
  - Full journey visualization from origin to destination
  - Chronologically ordered timeline items
  - Works for both origin departures and location-to-location transits
  - Timeline flow example:
    ```
    Jul 1, 10:00 AM  ‚îÇ Depart from San Francisco
                     ‚îÇ ‚úà IN TRANSIT (11h 30m, +16hr timezone shift)
    Jul 2, 2:30 PM   ‚îÇ Arrive in Tokyo
                     ‚îÇ Welcome to Tokyo!
    ```

- **Activity Time Validation** - Prevent scheduling conflicts ‚≠ê **Key Feature**
  - Activities can only be scheduled within location arrival/departure windows
  - Real-time validation in Add/Edit Activity dialogs
  - Clear error messages with valid time ranges
  - Validation rules:
    - Activity date must be within location dates
    - Start time must be after location arrival
    - End time must be before location departure
  - Example error: "Activity cannot start before location arrival (Jul 2, 2:30 PM)"
  - Utility: `ActivityValidation.kt` with `validateActivityTimeWindow()` function

### Fixed - Timeline Sorting Bug üêõ

**Problem:** Timeline items with colons in timestamps caused parsing errors
- Previous delimiter: `:` (colon) conflicted with ISO 8601 format
- Example problematic timestamp: `"2025-07-01T10:00:00-07:00:8:5"`
- Parsing `substringBeforeLast(":")` gave `"2025-07-01T10:00:00-07:00:8"`
- ZonedDateTime.parse() failed on trailing `:8`
- Items sorted incorrectly or disappeared from timeline

**Solution:** Changed delimiter from `:` to `|` (pipe character)
- Updated `getSortableTimestamp()` to use `|` separator
- Updated sorting logic: `substringBefore("|")` and `substringAfter("|")`
- Changed sort order type from `Int` to `Double` for fractional ordering
- InTransit now uses `|8.5` to sort between departure (8) and arrival (1)
- File: `TimelineTab.kt` (lines 275-300, 489-507)

### Changed

- **MockViewModel** - Enhanced timezone documentation
  - Added comprehensive timezone handling comments
  - Trip-level timezone strategy explanation
  - Outbound/return flight details with UTC offsets
  - Dateline crossing notes
  - Example: San Francisco (PDT/UTC-7) ‚Üî Tokyo (JST/UTC+9)

- **TimelineTab** - Added new timeline item types
  - `OriginDeparture` - For departures from non-Location cities
  - `InTransit` - For transit status with timezone transitions
  - Detection logic for origin city departures
  - Duplicate prevention with `processedTransitBookings` set

- **Activity Dialogs** - Added time window validation
  - `AddActivityDialog.kt` - Time validation with error display
  - `EditActivityDialog.kt` - Time validation with error display
  - Helper text showing valid time ranges
  - Real-time validation feedback

## [0.1.0] - 2025-01-15

### Added - Foundation
- **Project Setup**
  - Feature-First Clean Architecture
  - Gradle Kotlin DSL with Version Catalog
  - Minimum SDK: API 26 (Android 8.0)

- **Dependencies**
  - Room 2.8.2 for local database
  - Retrofit 2.11.0 + OkHttp 4.12.0 for networking
  - Hilt for dependency injection
  - Jetpack Compose with Material 3
  - Kotlin Coroutines + Flow for async operations

- **Database Layer** (`core/data/local/`)
  - **Entities** (6 core entities):
    - `Trip` - Main trip entity with Fixed/Flexible date support
    - `Location` - Trip locations with coordinates
    - `Activity` - Activities per location with time slots
    - `Booking` - Timezone-aware bookings (flights, hotels, etc.)
    - `Gap` - Detected gaps in itinerary
    - `TransitOption` - Transit suggestions for gaps
  - **DAOs** - Data Access Objects with Flow support for reactive queries
    - TripDao, LocationDao, ActivityDao, BookingDao, GapDao, TransitOptionDao
  - **Database** - TravlogueDatabase with TypeConverters
    - Enum converters for DateType, BookingType, GapType, TimeSlot, ActivityType, TransitMode
    - Foreign key relationships with CASCADE delete

- **Repository Layer** (`core/data/repository/`)
  - TripRepository - Trip CRUD operations
  - LocationRepository - Location management
  - ActivityRepository - Activity management
  - BookingRepository - Booking management
  - GapRepository - Gap detection data
  - TransitOptionRepository - Transit options
  - All repositories use Flow for reactive data

- **Dependency Injection** (`di/`)
  - DatabaseModule - Provides Room database and all DAOs
  - NetworkModule - Provides Retrofit and OkHttp with logging interceptor
  - Singleton scoped dependencies

- **Utilities** (`core/common/`)
  - **DateTimeUtils** - Comprehensive date/time helpers (30+ methods)
    - ISO date string conversions
    - ISO 8601 datetime with timezone support
    - Display formatting for dates and bookings
    - Date arithmetic (days between, add days)
    - Validation helpers
  - **BookingExamples** - Usage examples for timezone-aware bookings

- **Design System** (`core/design/`)
  - Material 3 color scheme
  - Typography definitions
  - Theme configuration

### Technical Decisions
- **Date/Time Strategy**:
  - Trip dates: ISO strings ("2025-11-15") for calendar dates
  - Booking datetimes: ISO 8601 with timezone ("2025-11-15T14:30:00+01:00")
  - System timestamps: Long (milliseconds) for created/updated fields
- **Architecture**: Feature-First Clean Architecture for scalability
- **DI**: Hilt for compile-time verified dependency injection
- **Reactive**: Flow for reactive data streams, StateFlow for UI state
- **Build**: Gradle Version Catalog for centralized dependency management
