## [0.1.0] - 2025-01-15

### Added - Foundation
- **Project Setup**
  - Feature-First Clean Architecture
  - Gradle Kotlin DSL with Version Catalog
  - Minimum SDK: API 26 (Android 8.0)

- **Dependencies**
  - Room 2.8.2 for local database
  - Retrofit 2.11.0 + OkHttp 4.12.0 for networking
  - Hilt for dependency injection
  - Jetpack Compose with Material 3
  - Kotlin Coroutines + Flow for async operations

- **Database Layer** (`core/data/local/`)
  - **Entities** (6 core entities):
    - `Trip` - Main trip entity with Fixed/Flexible date support
    - `Location` - Trip locations with coordinates
    - `Activity` - Activities per location with time slots
    - `Booking` - Timezone-aware bookings (flights, hotels, etc.)
    - `Gap` - Detected gaps in itinerary
    - `TransitOption` - Transit suggestions for gaps
  - **DAOs** - Data Access Objects with Flow support for reactive queries
    - TripDao, LocationDao, ActivityDao, BookingDao, GapDao, TransitOptionDao
  - **Database** - TravlogueDatabase with TypeConverters
    - Enum converters for DateType, BookingType, GapType, TimeSlot, ActivityType, TransitMode
    - Foreign key relationships with CASCADE delete

- **Repository Layer** (`core/data/repository/`)
  - TripRepository - Trip CRUD operations
  - LocationRepository - Location management
  - ActivityRepository - Activity management
  - BookingRepository - Booking management
  - GapRepository - Gap detection data
  - TransitOptionRepository - Transit options
  - All repositories use Flow for reactive data

- **Dependency Injection** (`di/`)
  - DatabaseModule - Provides Room database and all DAOs
  - NetworkModule - Provides Retrofit and OkHttp with logging interceptor
  - Singleton scoped dependencies

- **Utilities** (`core/common/`)
  - **DateTimeUtils** - Comprehensive date/time helpers (30+ methods)
    - ISO date string conversions
    - ISO 8601 datetime with timezone support
    - Display formatting for dates and bookings
    - Date arithmetic (days between, add days)
    - Validation helpers
  - **BookingExamples** - Usage examples for timezone-aware bookings

- **Design System** (`core/design/`)
  - Material 3 color scheme
  - Typography definitions
  - Theme configuration

### Technical Decisions
- **Date/Time Strategy**:
  - Trip dates: ISO strings ("2025-11-15") for calendar dates
  - Booking datetimes: ISO 8601 with timezone ("2025-11-15T14:30:00+01:00")
  - System timestamps: Long (milliseconds) for created/updated fields
- **Architecture**: Feature-First Clean Architecture for scalability
- **DI**: Hilt for compile-time verified dependency injection
- **Reactive**: Flow for reactive data streams, StateFlow for UI state
- **Build**: Gradle Version Catalog for centralized dependency management
