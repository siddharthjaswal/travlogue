## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Feature-First Architecture**
   - Each feature is self-contained and independent
   - Easy to navigate and understand
   - Ready to extract into modules if needed

2. **Incremental Development**
   - Each version built on the previous
   - No big-bang releases
   - Continuous testing and validation

3. **Type Safety**
   - Kotlin's type system caught many bugs
   - Type-safe navigation prevented routing errors
   - Compile-time verification of dependencies

4. **Preview-Driven Development**
   - @Preview annotations accelerated UI development
   - Instant feedback without running app
   - Easy to test different states

5. **Consistent Patterns**
   - Bottom action bars across all dialogs
   - Delete confirmations follow same pattern
   - Form validation consistent everywhere

### Challenges Overcome

1. **Smart Cast Issues**
   - **Problem:** Kotlin couldn't smart cast delegated properties
   - **Solution:** Used `let` scope function for safe unwrapping

2. **Date/Time Handling**
   - **Problem:** Multiple date/time formats needed
   - **Solution:** Created comprehensive DateTimeUtils

3. **Cascade Deletes**
   - **Problem:** Users might not realize location delete → activity delete
   - **Solution:** Added explicit warnings in UI

4. **Context Awareness**
   - **Problem:** Dialogs needed different behavior based on context
   - **Solution:** Pre-selection parameters in ViewModel

5. **Reactive Updates**
   - **Problem:** UI needed to update immediately after changes
   - **Solution:** Flow-based repository queries

## 🔍 What's Not in Phase 1 (Deferred to Phase 2)

The following features were intentionally deferred to keep Phase 1 focused:

- ❌ **Gap Detection** - Identifying missing transits (Phase 2 key feature)
- ❌ **API Integrations** - Weather, attractions, flights (Phase 2)
- ❌ **Edit Trip** - Modifying trip details (Phase 2)
- ❌ **Rich DateTime Picker** - Full date/time picker for bookings (Phase 2)
- ❌ **Image Attachments** - Booking screenshots (Phase 2)
- ❌ **Drag-to-Reorder** - Reordering locations (Phase 2)
- ❌ **Budget Tracking** - Cost management (Phase 3)
- ❌ **Collaboration** - Sharing trips (Phase 4)
- ❌ **Map Integration** - Visual location view (Phase 4)

These features are planned and documented but were not critical for MVP.
