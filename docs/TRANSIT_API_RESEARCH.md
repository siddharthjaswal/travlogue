# Transit API Research & Options

**Research Date:** January 2025
**For:** Travlogue v1.0 - Transit Suggestions Feature
**Purpose:** Evaluate API options for suggesting transit options (flights, trains, buses) for detected gaps

---

## üéØ Feature Goal

When the app detects a gap (location jump without transit), suggest transit options:
- üöÇ Train: $45, 2h 30m, Provider X
- ‚úàÔ∏è Flight: $120, 1h 15m, Airline Y
- üöå Bus: $25, 4h 00m, Company Z

## üí∞ API Options Comparison

| API | Free Tier | Paid Pricing | Coverage | Best For |
|-----|-----------|--------------|----------|----------|
| **Google Routes API** | Free monthly calls per SKU | $5-15 per 1,000 requests | Global, multi-modal | Comprehensive routing |
| **Amadeus API** | Free monthly quota | Pay per additional request | 400+ airlines, 90+ trains | Flights + trains with pricing |
| **Skyscanner API** | 50-100 req/min (approved partners) | Partner-only | Flights only | Flight comparison |
| **OpenTripPlanner** | ‚úÖ **100% FREE** (self-hosted) | Server hosting (~$10-20/mo) | Multi-modal (GTFS data) | Full control, privacy |
| **Transit APIs** | Free with capped calls | Unknown | 300 cities, 16 countries | Public transit |

## üìã Detailed API Analysis

### 1. Google Routes API (formerly Directions API)

**Status:** Directions API deprecated March 1, 2025 ‚Üí Migrated to Routes API

**Pricing Tiers:**
- **Basic:** $5 per 1,000 requests
- **Advanced:** $10 per 1,000 requests (real-time traffic, 11-25 waypoints)
- **Preferred:** $15 per 1,000 requests (toll calculation, advanced features)

**Free Tier:**
- Replaced previous $200/month credit with free monthly calls per SKU (exact limits not publicly specified)

**Transit-Specific Limits:**
- Maximum 100 elements per ComputeRouteMatrix request with travelMode=TRANSIT
- (Standard limit for other modes: 625 elements)

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Global coverage, high reliability
- ‚úÖ Real-time traffic and transit data
- ‚úÖ Well-documented, mature API
- ‚úÖ Easy integration with Google services
- ‚úÖ Free monthly quota available

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Can get expensive at scale ($5-15 per 1K requests)
- ‚ùå Transit requests have lower limits (100 vs 625 elements)
- ‚ùå Requires Google Cloud account setup
- ‚ùå Subject to Google's pricing changes

**Cost Example:**
- 1,000 users/month √ó 5 searches each = 5,000 requests
- 5,000 √ó $0.005 (Basic tier) = **$25/month**
- At 10,000 requests: **$50/month**

## üéØ Recommended Approach

### **Phase 1 (MVP): OpenTripPlanner**
**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks to set up

**Why:**
- ‚úÖ **Zero API costs** - perfect for MVP/testing
- ‚úÖ No approval process - start immediately
- ‚úÖ Real multi-modal routing (train/bus/walk/bike)
- ‚úÖ Uses public GTFS data (free, available for most major cities)
- ‚úÖ Full control, no vendor lock-in

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Set up OTP server using Docker
2. Deploy to Railway.app or Fly.io (free tier initially)
3. Download GTFS feeds for target regions (US, Europe, Asia)
4. Expose GraphQL API
5. Integrate with Travlogue Android app
6. Display routing suggestions (routes, times, modes)

**Limitations to Accept:**
- No live flight prices (show route + "Book on [Provider]" links)
- Requires periodic GTFS data updates
- Small server hosting cost (~$10-20/month at scale)

---

### **Phase 2 (Production): Hybrid Approach**
**Timeline:** After MVP validation

**Strategy:**
1. **OpenTripPlanner** - Primary routing engine (trains, buses, local transit)
2. **Amadeus API** - Flight pricing (when free tier available, after approval)
3. **Google Routes API** - Fallback for missing data (pay-per-use)

**Cost Estimate:**
- Server hosting: $10-20/month
- Amadeus API: $0 (free tier) + overage if needed
- Google Routes API: $10-30/month (occasional use)
- **Total: $20-70/month** for moderate traffic (thousands of users)

---

### **Phase 3 (Scale): Add Real-Time Pricing**
**Timeline:** After user validation, revenue generation

**Options:**
1. **Apply for Amadeus Partnership** - Flight/train pricing
2. **Skyscanner Integration** - Flight comparison (if approved)
3. **Affiliate Links** - Redirect to booking sites (Skyscanner, Kayak, etc.)
4. **Revenue Model** - Commission from bookings to offset API costs
